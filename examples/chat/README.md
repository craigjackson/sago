# Sago Chat

An example chat app that uses the sago library. This app shows how to define
your own action channel with "auth", and how to use a third-party extension in
your own app.

## Usage

```sh
$ go get github.com/craigjackson/sago
$ go run main.go
```

Go to http://localhost:4000/ in a browser. Open multiple tabs to that address
to chat with yourself.
